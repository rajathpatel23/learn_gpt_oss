### GPT OSS Architecture: A Detailed Deep-Dive

This document provides a detailed technical breakdown of the architectural components found in modern, high-performance, open-source GPT-style language models.

### 1. Tokenization & Embeddings

The journey from human-readable text to a format the model understands begins here.

*   **1.1. Tokenization**:
    *   First, raw text is converted into a sequence of integers called "tokens" using a tokenizer (e.g., Byte-Pair Encoding or BPE, as mentioned in `tokenization.md`).
    *   This process breaks down words into common sub-words. For example, `tokenization` might become `["token", "ization"]`. This allows the model to handle unknown words and understand morphological similarities (e.g., `run`, `running`).
    *   The set of all possible tokens forms the model's **vocabulary**.

*   **1.2. Token Embeddings**:
    *   **Process**: Each token ID is mapped to a high-dimensional vector.
        ```
        Input Text: "Hello world"
        Token IDs:  [15496, 995]
        Embeddings: [[0.1, -0.2, ...], [0.4, 0.9, ...]]  // Each vector has dimension `d_model` (e.g., 2880)
        ```
    *   **Goal**: To represent tokens in a continuous vector space where semantic relationships are captured by distance and direction.
    *   **Learned, Not Pre-trained**: These embedding vectors are initialized randomly and are **learned parameters**. During training, the model adjusts them via backpropagation to place semantically similar tokens closer together. This is far more powerful than using static, pre-trained embeddings like Word2Vec because the meanings become contextualized to the model's task.

### 2. Positional Information: Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)

Transformers are inherently permutation-invariant; they don't know the order of tokens. RoPE is a modern technique to inject this crucial information.

*   **The Goal**: We want the attention score between two tokens to depend on their content *and* their relative positions. For example, in "The ball flew... the dog caught **it**... **it** was a good throw", the two instances of "it" have the same semantic meaning (and thus the same base embedding), but their relationship to other words ("ball" vs. "throw") is defined by their position.

*   **The Core Idea**: Instead of adding positional information to the token embedding, RoPE encodes positional information by **rotating** the Query and Key vectors. The amount of rotation depends on the token's absolute position in the sequence.

*   **How It Works: Vector Rotation**
    1.  **Pairing Dimensions**: The `d`-dimensional Query and Key vectors are viewed as a sequence of `d/2` two-dimensional vectors. For a vector `v`, this would be `[(v_0, v_1), (v_2, v_3), ..., (v_{d-2}, v_{d-1})]`.
    2.  **Defining Frequencies**: A set of `d/2` different angular frequencies (or "wavelengths") `theta_i` are defined. These are fixed and not learned, typically set to `theta_i = 10000^(-2i/d)`. This means the first pairs rotate slowly (long wavelength) and later pairs rotate quickly (short wavelength).
    3.  **Applying Rotation**: For a token at position `m`, each 2D pair `(v_i, v_{i+1})` is rotated by an angle of `m * theta_i`. This is done using a 2D rotation matrix:
        ```
        [x'_i]   [cos(m*theta_i)  -sin(m*theta_i)] [x_i]
        [x'_{i+1}] = [sin(m*theta_i)   cos(m*theta_i)] [x_{i+1}]
        ```
        This operation is applied to both the Query vector `q` and the Key vector `k` before the attention score is calculated.

*   **The Magic: Encoding Relative Position**
    The brilliance of RoPE is that the dot product between a rotated query `q'` at position `m` and a rotated key `k'` at position `n` depends *only on their relative distance `m-n`*.

    *   **Derivation Sketch**: The dot product `q'_m Â· k'_n` can be expanded using the rotation matrix formula. After applying trigonometric identities (like `cos(A-B) = cosAcosB + sinAsinB`), the terms involving the absolute positions `m` and `n` cancel out, leaving a function that depends only on the original vectors `q`, `k`, and the relative position `m-n`.
    *   **Result**: The attention score between `q_m` and `k_n` becomes a function of their content and their relative distance, which is exactly what we want.

*   **Key Advantages**:
    1.  **Relative Position Encoding**: It naturally captures relative positional information, which is more intuitive for language.
    2.  **Good Extrapolation**: Because it's not tied to a fixed-length learned embedding, RoPE can generalize better to sequence lengths longer than those seen during training.
    3.  **Stability**: Rotation is a norm-preserving operation, meaning it doesn't change the length of the vectors, which helps maintain training stability.

### 3. RMS Normalization (RMSNorm)

A simple and efficient normalization layer used throughout the transformer blocks to stabilize training.

*   **Formula**:
    > `output = (x / RMS(x)) * g`
    > where `RMS(x) = sqrt(mean(x^2) + epsilon)`

*   `x` is the input vector, `g` (gain) is a learned parameter vector, and `epsilon` is a small constant for numerical stability.
*   **Advantages over LayerNorm**:
    *   **Simplicity & Speed**: By omitting the mean-centering step of LayerNorm (`x - mean(x)`), RMSNorm is computationally simpler and faster (~7-14% on GPUs).
    *   **Equivalent Performance**: In practice, for large transformer models, the centering operation provides little to no benefit, and RMSNorm performs just as well or better. The network can implicitly learn to offset values if needed.

---

### 4. The Transformer Block

The core repeating unit of the model. A model is a deep stack of these blocks. A single block consists of two main sub-layers: an attention mechanism and a feed-forward network.

#### 4.1. Attention Sub-Layer

This layer allows tokens to "look at" and gather information from other tokens in the sequence.

*   **Optimized Attention Variants**: To manage the computational and memory costs of standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA), modern models use more efficient variants.

| Variant | Query (Q) Heads | Key (K) Heads | Value (V) Heads | Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Multi-Head (MHA)** | N | N | N | High model quality, high memory cost. |
| **Multi-Query (MQA)** | N | 1 | 1 | Drastically reduces KV cache size, fastest inference. |
| **Grouped-Query (GQA)**| N | G (e.g., 4) | G (e.g., 4) | A balance between MHA's quality and MQA's speed. |

*   **Sliding Window Attention (SWA)**: To handle very long sequences efficiently, some models employ SWA. Instead of allowing every token to attend to every other previous token (which has a quadratic `O(n^2)` cost), SWA restricts each token to only attend to a fixed-size window of recent tokens (e.g., the last 4096 tokens).
    *   **Benefit**: This reduces the computational complexity to `O(n * w)`, where `w` is the window size, enabling the model to process much longer contexts with a linear cost.
    *   **Example**: The Mistral 7B model is a prominent example that uses Sliding Window Attention to achieve a large effective context window while maintaining high efficiency.
    *   **Interaction with KV Cache**: SWA's most significant impact is on the KV Cache. Instead of growing indefinitely, the cache becomes a **fixed-size rolling buffer**. It only needs to store the keys and values for the last `w` tokens. When a new token is generated, the oldest token's K/V pair is discarded, and the new one is added. This keeps memory usage constant and bounded, regardless of the total sequence length.

#### 4.1.1. Information Propagation Beyond the Sliding Window

A common question about SWA is: if a token can only see the last `W` tokens, isn't all prior information lost? The answer is **no**, due to a transitive information flow. Information from outside the window is not accessed directly, but its essence is carried forward through two mechanisms:

1.  **Horizontal Propagation (Token-to-Token)**:
    *   The token at position `N` attends to the token at position `N-1`.
    *   The token at `N-1` has already attended to the token at `N-2`, and so on, back to `N-W`.
    *   Therefore, the representation of token `N-1` contains a summary of its own attention window. When token `N` attends to `N-1`, it indirectly accesses this summarized information. This creates a "ripple effect" where the semantic context is passed down from one token to the next.

2.  **Vertical Propagation (Layer-to-Layer)**:
    *   This effect is amplified across the model's layers. The output representation of a token from Layer 1, which has gathered information from its local window, becomes the *input* to Layer 2.
    *   In Layer 2, when a token attends to its neighbors, it's attending to representations that have *already* summarized information from the previous layer.
    *   Because of this, the "effective receptive field" of a token grows with each layer. By the final layer, a token's representation has been influenced by information that originated far outside its immediate `W`-sized attention window.

*   **KV Cache Size Impact**: The choice of attention mechanism directly impacts the size of the KV Cache. MQA and GQA reduce the cache size by reducing the number of K/V heads. SWA reduces it by limiting the sequence length dimension of the cache.

*   **Attention Bias**: An optional matrix added to the `Q @ K^T` scores before the softmax. It's a flexible tool for:
    1.  **Causal Masking**: Setting scores for future tokens to `-infinity` to prevent a token from "cheating" and seeing the future. This is essential for auto-regressive generation.
    2.  **Positional Biases**: Implementing alternative positional encoding schemes like ALiBi (Attention with Linear Biases), where the bias penalizes attention between distant tokens.

#### 4.1.2. Attention Bias (details)

-   **Definition**: The attention logits are computed as `attn_logits = (Q @ K^T) * scale + bias`, where `bias` is added before the softmax and can be broadcast across heads and/or sequence positions.
    -   Typical shapes: `[num_heads, 1, seq_len, seq_len]`, `[1, seq_len, seq_len]`, or block-sparse masks.
-   **Common uses**:
    -   **Causal mask**: Upper-triangular entries set to `-inf` to enforce left-to-right decoding.
    -   **ALiBi (linear distance penalty)**: Per-head slopes applied as a negative linear function of token distance; compatible with RoPE and lightweight to implement.
    -   **Relative position bias (T5-style)**: Learned bucketed biases that favor nearby tokens without explicit rotations.
    -   **Segment/turn/document biases**: Down-weight cross-segment attention (e.g., between chat turns) or up-weight separators.
    -   **Task-specific nudges**: Small positive bias to encourage attending to prefixes, BOS, or special control tokens.
-   **Implementation notes**:
    -   The bias is added additively and can be static (no gradients; e.g., causal mask, ALiBi) or learned.
    -   Works independently of RoPE/MQA/GQA and with FlashAttention by fusing masks/biases into the softmax kernel.
    -   Memory cost is minimal due to broadcasting; compute overhead is negligible.

#### 4.1.3. Attention Sinks

-   **Intuition**: Reserve a small number of early positions (e.g., the first `m` tokens) as "sink" tokens that every query can always attend to. These serve as stable anchors that preserve global context, especially under streaming or sliding-window inference.
-   **Why it helps**:
    -   Prevents quality drop when tokens outside the current window are no longer directly visible.
    -   Provides a consistent fallback target, stabilizing attention distributions and downstream normalization statistics.
    -   Acts like a "heat sink": it can absorb a small, consistent fraction of attention mass to avoid brittle sparsity.
-   **Mechanism**:
    -   Keep the K/V for the sink positions permanently in the KV cache, even when using SWA that evicts old tokens.
    -   Add a small positive bias `+b_sink` to logits targeting sink indices so that they receive a modest probability mass after softmax (e.g., 1â5%).
    -   Optionally insert dedicated sink tokens (or reuse BOS) with embeddings tuned for summarization/aggregation.
-   **Practical guidance**:
    -   Choose `m` in the range 1â4; set `b_sink` to achieve a small but nontrivial attention share.
    -   Can be introduced at inference-time only, but works best if the model is trained or finetuned with sink behavior.
    -   Compatible with RoPE, MQA/GQA, SWA, and FlashAttention.
-   **Reference**: Efficient Streaming of Language Models with Attention Sinks ([arXiv:2309.17453](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17453)).

```python
# Pseudocode (inference-time biasing with m sink tokens)
def add_attention_bias(attn_logits, sink_indices, b_sink):
    # attn_logits: [batch, heads, q_len, k_len]
    # sink_indices: list/tensor of length m with K-side positions to favor
    attn_logits[..., sink_indices] += b_sink
    return attn_logits

# With sliding-window caching: always retain K/V at sink_indices
def update_kv_cache(cache, new_k, new_v, sink_indices, window_size):
    # Keep sinks + last (window_size - len(sink_indices)) positions
    retained = concat(cache.kv_at(sink_indices), cache.kv_last(window_size - len(sink_indices)))
    cache.k, cache.v = roll_and_append(retained, new_k, new_v)
    return cache
```

#### 4.2. Feed-Forward Network (FFN) Sub-Layer

This is where the model does much of its "thinking" and knowledge recall.

*   **Standard FFN**: A simple two-layer MLP: `FFN(x) = ReLU(x @ W1 + b1) @ W2 + b2`.
*   **SwiGLU Variant**: Modern models often use a more advanced variant called SwiGLU (Gated Linear Unit with a Swish/SiLU activation) for better performance.
    > `SwiGLU(x) = (SiLU(x @ W1) * (x @ W_gate)) @ W2`
    *   It uses three weight matrices instead of two. The gating mechanism (`x @ W_gate`) allows the network to dynamically control how much information flows through the main path, leading to improved training and final model quality.

*   **Mixture of Experts (MoE)**: To scale up model size efficiently, the FFN sub-layer can be replaced with an MoE layer.
    *   **Architecture**: Instead of one large FFN, there are multiple smaller FFNs (the "experts").
    *   **Routing**: A small "gating network" or "router" (a simple linear layer + softmax) looks at each token's hidden state and outputs probabilities for which expert should process it.
    *   **Sparse Activation**: Typically, only the top-2 experts are chosen for each token. The final output is a weighted sum of the outputs from these two experts.
    *   **Benefit**: This allows for a massive increase in the total number of parameters in the model, while the computational cost per token remains constant. A "load balancing loss" is often added during training to ensure all experts are utilized.
*   **Load Balancing Loss**: This is a crucial auxiliary loss function added during training. It penalizes the model if the router sends a disproportionate number of tokens to only a few "favorite" experts. This ensures that all experts receive a steady stream of training data, preventing router collapse and ensuring all parts of the network are effectively utilized.

#### 4.3. Residual Connections

Residual connections (or "skip connections") are the architectural glue that holds the transformer block together and, more importantly, allows the model to be trained at great depths.

*   **How it Works**: A residual connection is a direct data path that bypasses a sub-layer (like attention or FFN). The output of the sub-layer is then *added* to the original input that went into it.
    > `output = input + SubLayer(LayerNorm(input))`

*   **Why They Are Critical**:
    1.  **Combating Vanishing Gradients**: This is the primary reason for their existence. In very deep networks, gradients can shrink exponentially as they are propagated backward from the final layer to the initial layers. This causes the early layers to learn extremely slowly or not at all. The residual connection acts as an "information superhighway," allowing the gradient to flow directly and unimpeded back through the network. This ensures that even the earliest layers receive a strong learning signal.
    2.  **Preserving Information**: Each sub-layer transforms its input. The residual connection guarantees that the original, untransformed information from the beginning of the block is carried forward. The sub-layer's job is simplified: it only needs to learn the *residual*âthe change or update that should be applied to the original vectorârather than the entire transformation from scratch. This makes learning easier and prevents information loss.

Without residual connections, training transformers with dozens or hundreds of layers would be practically impossible.

### 5. Key-Value (KV) Cache

A critical optimization that makes auto-regressive text generation practical and fast.

*   **The Problem**: During generation, to predict token `N+1`, the model needs to attend to all previous tokens `1...N`. Naively re-calculating the Key (K) and Value (V) vectors for the entire context at every single step is computationally prohibitive.
*   **The Solution**: The KV cache is a memory buffer that stores the K and V vectors once they are computed.
    *   **Step 1**: Process prompt "The cat". Compute and cache `K_the`, `V_the`, `K_cat`, `V_cat`.
    *   **Step 2**: Generate next token. Let's say it's "sat". The model computes `Q_sat` and attends to the cached `[K_the, K_cat]` and `[V_the, V_cat]`.
    *   **Step 3**: After generating "sat", compute `K_sat` and `V_sat` and *append* them to the cache. The cache now holds K/V for "The cat sat".
    *   **Note**: With Sliding Window Attention, this cache would be a fixed-size rolling buffer rather than an ever-growing list (see section 4.1).
    *   This turns a quadratic operation (recomputing everything) into a linear one (computing for one new token), making generation feasible for long sequences.

### 6. Overall Architecture & Workflow

Putting it all together, the data flows through the model as follows:

1.  **Input**: Raw text is passed to the **Tokenizer**, producing a sequence of token IDs.
2.  **Embedding Layer**: The token IDs are converted into **Token Embedding** vectors.
3.  **Transformer Blocks (Stacked `L` times)**: The vectors are processed sequentially through `L` identical transformer blocks. For each block:
    a. **Pre-Attention Norm**: `x_norm1 = RMSNorm(x)`
    b. **Attention**: `attn_out = GQA(Q=x_norm1, K=x_norm1, V=x_norm1)` (with RoPE applied to Q and K internally).
    c. **First Residual Connection**: `x_res1 = x + attn_out`
    d. **Pre-FFN Norm**: `x_norm2 = RMSNorm(x_res1)`
    e. **Feed-Forward Network**: `ffn_out = MoE(x_norm2)` (or a SwiGLU FFN).
    f. **Second Residual Connection**: `x = x_res1 + ffn_out` (This `x` becomes the input to the next block).
4.  **Final Projection**:
    a. After the last block, a final `RMSNorm` is applied to the output.
    b. A linear layer (the "un-embedding" or "language model head") projects the final high-dimensional vector back to the size of the vocabulary, producing **logits**.
5.  **Softmax**: The logits are converted into probabilities over the entire vocabulary to predict the most likely next token.
6.  **Inference Loop**: For generation, this process is repeated, using the **KV Cache** to maintain context and efficiently produce one token at a time.
